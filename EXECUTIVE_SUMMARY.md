## SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

```
Technology Stack:
├─ Frontend: Next.js 15.2.8 + React 19 + TypeScript
├─ UI: Radix UI (24+ components) + Tailwind CSS
├─ State: DataStore (Singleton) + localStorage + IndexedDB
├─ Backend: Express.js (5.2.1, needs upgrade)
├─ SMS: Twilio SDK (properly configured)
├─ Storage: localStorage (5-10MB) + IndexedDB (50MB+) + In-Memory
├─ PWA: Service Worker v1.1 + manifest.json + Offline support
└─ Monitoring: Sentry, DataDog (to be added)

Current Issues:
├─ ❌ No real backend database
├─ ❌ No server-side authentication
├─ ❌ No persistent data storage
├─ ❌ No encryption
├─ ❌ No rate limiting
└─ ⚠️ Multiple CSS frameworks (bloat)
```

## CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES

### Severity 🔴 CRITICAL (3 issues)

1. **Plaintext Credential Storage**
   - PIN stored in localStorage readable by JavaScript
   - **Attack**: Open DevTools → Copy credentials → Login as user
   - **Fix**: Implement backend authentication with JWT

2. **No Backend Validation**
   - All authentication client-side, no server checks
   - **Attack**: Override auth logic in browser → Direct app access
   - **Fix**: Move authentication to backend server

3. **No Real Database**
   - All data mock, transactions not persisted
   - **Attack**: Not a real attack, app just doesn't work
   - **Fix**: Implement PostgreSQL backend with API

### Severity 🟠 HIGH (7 issues)

4. **No Rate Limiting** → Brute force possible
5. **CSS Framework Bloat** → Performance degradation
6. **No Error Boundaries** → App crashes on component error
7. **Type Checking Disabled** → Hidden bugs
8. **No Encryption** → Data exposed
9. **Race Conditions** → Data consistency issues
10. **No Session Management** → Account security

---

## BREAKDOWN BY AREA

### Authentication: FAILED ❌
```
Current: Client-side only, plaintext PIN
Target: Server-side JWT, encrypted passwords
Status: Complete rewrite needed
Complexity: High
Risk: Critical (entire system security)
```

### Database: FAILED ❌
```
Current: Mock data in localStorage
Target: PostgreSQL with transactions
Status: Needs creation from scratch
Complexity: High
Risk: Critical (no real transactions)
```

### API Integration: PARTIAL ⚠️
```
Current: Twilio SMS working, other APIs missing
Target: 30+ endpoints for all operations
Status: Needs backend implementation
Complexity: Medium-High
Risk: High (no transaction processing)
```

### Frontend: GOOD ✅
```
Current: Modern UI, responsive, accessible
Target: Connect to real backend
Status: Mostly ready, needs integration
Complexity: Medium
Risk: Low (UI is solid)
```

### Security: FAILED ❌
```
Current: No encryption, no rate limiting, no validation
Target: TLS, encryption, rate limiting, validation
Status: Complete implementation needed
Complexity: High
Risk: Critical (regulatory & legal)
```

### Testing: FAILED ❌
```
Current: No tests (0% coverage)
Target: 80%+ unit, 70%+ integration, 90%+ e2e
Status: Testing framework needs setup
Complexity: Medium
Risk: High (no quality assurance)
```

### Deployment: PARTIAL ⚠️
```
Current: Vercel setup, no monitoring
Target: Blue-green deployment, full monitoring
Status: Needs devops setup
Complexity: Medium
Risk: Medium (no observability)
```
